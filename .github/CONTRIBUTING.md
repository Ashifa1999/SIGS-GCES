# How can I contribute?

## Reporting a Bug

* This project follows a [_Issue_](https://github.com/GCES-2018-2/SIGS-GCES/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) pattern. So if you find a bug, make sure it is not in one of our [_Issues_](https://github.com/GCES-2018-2/SIGS-GCES/issues). Bugs should be marked with _label (tag)_ __bug__.

* If the bug found is not in the _Issues_, just open a [_New Issue_](https://github.com/GCES-2018-2/SIGS-GCES/issues/new).

## Adding and/or modifying some functionality

* First, check that there is no [_Issue_](https://github.com/GCES-2018-2/SIGS-GCES/issues) regarding this modification and/or addition.

* If it does not exist, create a [_New Issue_](https://github.com/GCES-2018-2/SIGS-GCES/issues/new). Give a meaningful title to it, put a description and at least a _label_.

* Changes must be submitted through [_Pull Requests_](https://github.com/GCES-2018-2/SIGS-GCES/compare). You can find more about this in the [_Pull Requests Template_](https://github.com/GCES-2018-2/SIGS-GCES/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
